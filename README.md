# s2s-renderer (scaffold)

Purpose: scenes.json → headless render → ffmpeg encode → video artifact (PoC scaffold)

Definition of Done (scaffold):
- Repository skeleton with folder structure and placeholder files.
- Minimal docs (design/runbook/ci) with headings only.
- test fixture placeholder: test/fixtures/scenes-sample.json

Notes:
- This scaffold contains only placeholders and light README content so you can copy/paste into Working Copy.
- Do NOT add implementation code here until you explicitly request "code unlock".
